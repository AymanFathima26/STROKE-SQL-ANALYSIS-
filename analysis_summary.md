# Analysis Summary — Stroke SQL Analysis
This document provides a comprehensive interpretation of the SQL-based analysis conducted on the stroke dataset. It synthesizes epidemiological patterns, identifies high-risk groups, and highlights major determinants of stroke based on demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and biometric indicators.

## 1. Overview
The dataset includes 5,110 records with demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and biometric variables. Among these, 249 individuals experienced a stroke, representing an overall prevalence of **4.87%**. The analysis focuses on understanding how stroke prevalence varies across key subgroups.

## 2. Demographic Determinants
### **Age**
Age was the strongest demographic predictor of stroke.
* **60+ years:** 13.15% prevalence — the highest of all age groups.
* **45–59 years:** 4.83%.
* **30–44 years:** 0.79%.
* **18–29 years:** 0.13%.
**Interpretation:** Stroke risk increases substantially with age, particularly after age 60, aligning with established epidemiological patterns.

### **Sex**
* **Males:** 5.11%.
* **Females:** 4.71%.
**Interpretation:** Males show a slightly higher risk, consistent with global stroke data.

### **Residence**
* **Urban:** 5.20%.
* **Rural:** 4.53%.
**Interpretation:** Urban areas show marginally higher prevalence, potentially due to lifestyle and environmental factors.

## 3. Lifestyle Risk Factors
### **Smoking Status**
* Former smokers (7.91%) showed the highest prevalence.
* Current smokers (5.32%) also had increased risk.
**Interpretation:** Both current and former smoking are associated with elevated stroke risk. The high prevalence among former smokers suggests cumulative exposure effects.

### **Smoking Risk Groups**
Stroke risk increases with smoking intensity:
* Medium: 7.91%.
* High: 5.32%.
* Low: 4.76%.

## 4. Clinical Risk Factors
### **Hypertension**
* No hypertension: 3.97%.
* **With hypertension:** 13.25%.
**Interpretation:** Hypertension is one of the strongest predictors, with risk more than tripling.

### **Heart Disease**
* No heart disease: 4.18%.
* **With heart disease:** 17.03%.
**Interpretation:** Heart disease increased stroke prevalence fourfold, highlighting the link between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health.

## 5. Biometric Indicators
### **BMI Categories**
* Unknown BMI: 19.90%.
* Overweight: 5.32%.
* Obese: 5.10%.
* Normal: 2.82%.
* Underweight: 0.30%.
**Interpretation:** Higher BMI correlates with greater stroke prevalence. A notably high rate among the "Unknown" group suggests potential data quality issues or underdocumentation in high-risk individuals.

### **Mean BMI**
* Stroke: 30.47.
* Non-stroke: 28.82.
**Interpretation:** Stroke individuals tend to have higher BMI, reinforcing the link with metabolic risk.

### **Glucose Levels**
* Stroke: 132.54 mg/dL.
* Non-stroke: 104.79 mg/dL.
**Interpretation:** Higher average glucose levels among stroke patients suggest possible diabetes or glucose dysregulation as important determinants.

## 6. Crosstab Analysis Summary
Crosstabs reinforced key risk associations:
* Hypertension: 66 stroke vs. 183 non-stroke.
* Heart disease: 47 stroke vs. 202 non-stroke.
* Smoking: Higher stroke count among smokers and former smokers.
* BMI: Highest stroke counts among overweight and obese groups.
**Interpretation:** The consistency across prevalence, means, and crosstabs strengthens the conclusion that cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors are major contributors.

## 7. Key Insights
1. **Age, hypertension, and heart disease** are the most significant predictors of stroke.
2. Stroke prevalence increases sharply after **age 60**.
3. **Obesity and high glucose levels** are important metabolic risk factors.
4. Smoking increases risk; former smokers show highest prevalence.
5. Urban dwellers show slightly higher stroke prevalence.
6. Missing BMI data may indicate hidden high-risk subgroups.

## 8. Public Health Interpretation
The results align with established global stroke trends. High-risk populations identified—older adults, those with hypertension, heart disease, elevated glucose, and high BMI—are priority groups for health education, early screening, and preventive interventions.
This analysis provides a strong example of SQL applied to real-world health data and supports informed decision-making in public health and clinical settings.
